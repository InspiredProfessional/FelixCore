# FelixCore
We want to create an application that allows the students to find all their needs within the university all in one place. 
We believe this will boost the student life and allow the students participate in events they might have missed during the semester. 
It will allow incoming students to get familiar with the Firebird culture and have all the information in one application. 
Convenience is the key.
